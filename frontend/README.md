# Giftus
# Distinctiveness and Complexity
**Giftus** is a gift registry app where users can create and view wishlists. Users **cannot** communicate or interact with one another.

The app is split between the backend, which works as a REST API, and the frontend built in React.

The Django backend utilizes the [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/). I also took up the challenge of implementing user authentication via web tokens, using Simple JWT, a JSON Web Token authentication plugin for the Django REST Framework. In the process of building this part of the app I was able to gain new skills on DRF concepts, HTTP responses, serializers, REST APIs, while making use of my knowledge of models, data manipulation and other Django concepts.

In addition, I chose to build the frontend using React because I wanted to continue my journey of learning this framework and finally tackling a full stack Django+React project. The frontend utilizes multiple pages and components and communicates with the backend via API. Not only did I enjoy using the JS and React skills learned through CS50W, but, more importantly, I also approached new concepts and improved my React knowledge: state and context hooks, user auth with web tokens, fetching data, styling components.

The app is mobile responsive.
